Hello world üëã  

I am a Research Engineer at ETH with [Luca Corinzia](https://ise.inf.ethz.ch/people/person-detail.html?persid=233424) and [Matteo Turchetta](https://las.inf.ethz.ch/people/matteo-turchetta). The project aims to apply Reinforcement Learning to Genomic Selection. In particular, we are building a novel RL environment that simulates breeding programs to be able to train a policy that optimizes some traits. Traits include food yield, resistance to climate change, diseases, etc. The food shortage will be a humanitarian challenge soon due to the rapid increase in demand that cannot be satisfied by current crop varieties and farming practices (see [Voss-Fels et al.](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-019-0638-4)).
For this project, we are collaborating with multiple labs across ETH and WUR. 
<!-- I am at EPFL as a visiting student in the *Machine Learning and Optimization Laboratory*. I am researching under the supervision of [Thijs Vogels](https://thijs.link/) on improvements for PowerSGD. I am also an AI Master's student at the University of Bologna; previously, I took my Bachelor's in Computer Engineering at University of Brescia.   -->
My main research interests are improving *Reinforcement Learning* generalisation with *Meta-Learning* techniques, and *Continual Reinforcement Learning*. Anyway, I tend to be passionate about everything around AI; currently, I am exploring Dynamic Neural Networks. 

Since I was young, I like programming and open-source culture üë®‚Äçüíª  
In this lovely journey, I contributed to several projects, including *OpenAI gym* and *PyTorch*.
